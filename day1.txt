1.enumerate the diff b/w java and javaScript ?
ans:
#
- JavaScript is a lightweight programming language(“scripting language”) and is used to make web pages interactive.
- It can insert dynamic text into HTML. 
-JavaScript is also known as the browser’s language.
- JavaScript(JS) is not similar or related to Java. 
-Both the languages have a C-like syntax and are widely used in client-side and server-side Web applications, but there are few similarities only.

Features of Javascript are as follows: 

-JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation.
- Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.
- Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like another object. 
- They can be passed as arguments in other functions.
Can handle date and time.
- Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.
- No compiler is needed.

# Java is an object-oriented programming language and has a virtual machine platform that allows you to create compiled programs that run on nearly every platform. Java promised, “Write Once, Run Anywhere”.

Features of Java are as follows: 

1. Platform Independent: The compiler converts source code to bytecode and then the JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler. This bytecode can run on any platform.

2. Object-Oriented Programming Language:  Organizing the program in the terms of collection of objects is a way of object-oriented programming, each of which represents an instance of the class. There are 4 pillars of OOP’s concept:

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
3. Simple: Java is one of the simple languages as it does not have complex features like pointers, operator overloading, multiple inheritances, and Explicit memory allocation.

4. Robust: Java language is robust which means reliable. It is developed in such a way that it puts a lot of effort into checking errors as early as possible, that is why the java compiler is able to detect even those errors that are not easy to detect by another programming language.

5. Secure: In java, we don’t have pointers, and so we cannot access out-of-bound arrays i.e it shows ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception if we try to do so.

6. Distributed:  We can create distributed applications using the java programming language. Remote Method Invocation and Enterprise Java Beans are used for creating distributed applications in java.

7. Multithreading: Java supports multithreading. It is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of the CPU.

Q.what are javaScript: dataType ?
ans:
- JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc
- JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types: 

- JavaScript is also a weakly typed language, which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.
- JavaScript types
- The set of types in the JavaScript language consists of primitive values and objects(Non-primitive (reference) data type).

JavaScript primitive data types:
String	represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"
Number	represents numeric values e.g. 100
Boolean	represents boolean value either false or true
Undefined	represents undefined value
Null	represents null i.e. no value at all

non-primitive:
Object	represents instance through which we can access members
Array	represents group of similar values
RegExp	represents regular expression

Q.what is the use of isNAN function ?
ans:
- The isNaN() function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It returns true if value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the Number.

Q what are undeclared and undefined variables ?
ans:
- Undefined variable means a variable has been declared but it does not have a value.
-  Undeclared variable means that the variable does not exist in the program at all.
- If you try to access an undeclared variable in JavaScript, you get a ReferenceError. This is consistent because if there is no such variable, you cannot use it.

Q.what are feature of ES6 ?
ans: 
- ES6 or the ECMAScript 2015 is the 6th and major edition of the ECMAScript language specification standard. It defines the standard for the implementation of JavaScript and it has become much more popular than the previous edition ES5
- ES6 comes with significant changes to the JavaScript language. 
- It brought several new features like, let and const keyword, rest and spread operators, template literals, classes, modules and many other enhancements to make JavaScript programming easier and more fun.
let and const Keywords
- Arrow Functions
- Multi-line Strings
- Default Parameters
- Template Literals
- Destructuring Assignment
- Enhanced Object Literals
- Promises
- Classes
- Modules

Q.what are the global variables : how they are declared ?
- Global Variables are the variables that can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
- These are the variables that are declared in the main body of the source code and outside all the functions.
- These variables are available to every function to access.
- Var keyword is used to declare variables globally

Q.what is === operator in javascript?
- The strict equality operator ( === ) checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different

//  operator precedence
Q.what would be the result of 3+2+"7 ?
- 57

Q.what would be the result of 3+2+"7 ?
- -2

Q.what are the different types of errors in javascript?
- There are three main types of errors that can occur while compiling a JavaScript program: syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors.

Q.what is the 'strict' mode in javascript and how can it be enabled ?
- "use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".
- The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode". With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables. The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the directive. You can use strict mode in all your programs.
- You can use strict mode in all your programs. It helps you to write cleaner code, like preventing you from using undeclared variables.
-"use strict" is just a string, so IE 9 will not throw an error even if it does not understand it.
- The "use strict" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5

Q.what are objects in js and how did you define them ?
-  objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object

Q.what is javaScript prototype ?
- Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another
- Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another

Q.what is closure/ example of closure ?
- A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

- function init() {
  var name = 'Mozilla'; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, a closure
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
init();

Q.what is for-in loop in javascript ?
- The for...in statements combo iterates (loops) over the properties of an object.
- The code block inside the loop is executed once for each property.

Q.anonymous function ?
- An anonymous function is a function without a name. 
- The following shows how to define an anonymous function:

(function () {
   //...
});
- Note that if you don’t place the anonymous function inside the (), you’ll get a syntax error. The () makes the anonymous function an expression that returns a function object.
- An anonymous function is not accessible after its initial creation. Therefore, you often need to assign it to a variable.
- For example, the following shows an anonymous function that displays a message:
let show = function() {
    console.log('Anonymous function');
};

show();

Q.what is the use of setTimeOut & setInterval ?
- SetTimeout and SetInterval are the only native function in javaScript that is used to run code asynchronously , it means allow the function to executed immediately , there is no need to wait for current execution completion , it will for further to execute.
- setTimeout() method The setTimeout() method executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.

-Supported Browser: The browser supported by setTimeout() & setInterval() Method are listed nelow:

- Google Chrome 1 and above
-  Edge 12 and above
- Internet Explorer 4 and above
- Firefox 1 and above
- Opera 4 and above
- Safari 1 and above
